  <title>Test and Build</title>

  <para>One of the key features of Boost librariies is that they are
  extensively tested. This is done by volunteers who test all the libraries on
  particular platforms. From our perspecitve here, this has a number of
  drawbacks:</para>

  <para><itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>It is very demanding on the voluteers. Usually takes all night
        to run tests on all of boost.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The environments being tested might or might not be the same as
        those platforms that users actually use.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>It's not obvious how to test just one library.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>It only includes libraries already accepted into boost. So it is
        of no help to target audience of this web site.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>To address these considerations we will require that every
  library submission include the following:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>A reasonably complete set of tests which can be run by anyone who
      downloads the library.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>A test script for running these tests.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>This will permit any users of a submitted library to run his own
  tests. </para>

  <para>Elsewhere on this website, we'll describe the test system we
  recommend.</para>
