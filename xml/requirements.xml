  <title>Library Requirements</title>

  <para>Any library submitted to this site must fulfill a set of minimum set
  of requirements. These requirements are formulated in order to make it as
  simple as possible to download a library, test and use it. The only
  requirement that a potential user should have to fulfill is that the a
  recent copy of Boost Libraries be installed.</para>

  <para>Note that some of these requirements may differ somewhat from the
  official Boost ones. So if/when the library is added the official Boost
  distribution. Some changes will have to be made. These changes should be
  easy to make and not require much additional investment of effort.</para>
