  <title>Library Suggestion</title>

  <para>Have a great idea for a library? Hoping that someone else will make
  it? Do you something started that you'd like to see someone take over? Or do
  you just leave a reminder that the library is needed. Perhaps someone else
  will see this and point to some other solution.</para>
