  <title>Simple Tools</title>

  <para>Strictly speaking, it is irrelevent which tools a library author uses
  to meet the <link linkend="requirements">Library Requirements</link>.
  However in practice, the library author's selection to edit, build, test and
  document the library have a huge influence on whether or not a library is
  likely to be successful. I experimented with various tools to see how suited
  they were to the task. The results of these experiments are described below.
  Unfortunately, it turns out that we can't achieve all we want with this
  website without specifying some specific tools.</para>

  <para>Here we describe a number of different tools which might be
  considered.</para>
