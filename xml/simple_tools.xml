  <title>Simple Tools</title>

  <para>Ideally, one would prefer to have no requirement as to the specific
  tools to be used as long as the <link linkend="requirements">Library
  Requirements</link> are satisfied. To this end, I experimented with various
  tools to see how they fit theset requirements. The results of these
  experiments are described below. Unfortunately, it turns out that we can't
  achieve all we want with this website without specifying some specific
  tools.</para>

  <para>On the other hand, we've tried to minimise the requirements as to any
  specific tools used.</para>

  <para>With the exception of Boost Build for testing, authors are free to use
  the tools of his choosing. Here we describe a number of different tools
  which might be considered.</para>
