Notes on local development
==========================

I've had a lot of trouble getting my MAC setup for local WordPress development.

a) I used the pages at http://codex.wordpress.org/MacOS_X_Local_Mirror
and http://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/get-apache-mysql-php-phpmyadmin-working-osx-10-9-mavericks/ to:
   1) enable the local versions of Apache Server and PHP
   2) create local mirror of Blincubator.com
   3) Install and configure MySQL
   4) Install and configure phpMyAdmin - UI for administering MySQL

b) Backup the BLincubator website into two files.  
   1) One for the WP theme/plugin/php code
   2) One for the database tables

c) Using phpMySQL - load the backup database tables into the local database

d) WordPress requires the usage of global urls (permalinks) in order to function.
This makes it effectively impossible to move the installation to another server.
To get around this, we use create an .htaccess file in the Sites directory which
enables the filtering and modification of all links which specify blincubator.com
into

http://rrsd.com/blincubator.com/

http://localhost/~robertramey

e) useful information:
   1) the apache error log on mac os is located at /var/log/apache2/error_log
