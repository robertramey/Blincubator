    http://www.blincubator.com/bi_library/safe-numerics I expect to be able to
    jump directly to the library page for the safe-numerics library. I would

    library as well as the web site as a whole. It's a great package and has
    served us very well. Still there a few issues which I would like to see
    resolved.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>users can only see the slimstat statistics pages if they are
          logged in to the site. I would like to eliminate this requirement
          but haven't been able to figure out how to do this.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>On the page for each library I'd like to gather and display
          the following</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>number of times the repo link has been invoked</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>number of times the download link has been

          followed the link to the library repo. I want to do this so I can
          email them a reminder to review and/or comment on the library after
          they've had a chance to evaluate it.</p></li></ul></div></div></div>
