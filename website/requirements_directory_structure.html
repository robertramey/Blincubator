</code></pre><p>This is identical to the recently updated Boost directory structure
  requirements. It's designed so that the library is contained in one
  directory structure and need not occupy a specific place within any higher
  level structure.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The library directory and files can be placed anywhere in the
      users file hierarchy.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>There is no requirement to alter the users Boost directory. The
      library can be used just by making sure the include directory is
      available during the compilations of source files which use it.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If the library user prefers to have all his "boost like" libraries
      in the boost header space, he can make a link or forwarding header in
      his boost directory tree to accomplish this.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The library may include files named <a href="Jamroot.jam">Jamroot.jam</a> to support the Bjam build
      system.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The library may include files named CMakeLists.txt to support the
      CMake build system</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Other build system support is optional. If supplied it should be
      either as one file (example: bjam) or as a subdirectory with multiple
      files.</p></li></ul></div><p>Note that there is no reason that support for more than one build
  system cannot be included.</p></div>
