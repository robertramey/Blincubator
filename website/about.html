<div class="section" title="About This Website"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="idm513276624288"></a>About This Website</h2></div></div><hr></div><p>This web site is an effort to support the creation of more quality C++
  libraries by</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Specifying the minimal requirements that a C++ library must
        fulfill to be useful to the C++ community.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Suggesting the tools and methods to meet those requirements with
        minimal effort.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Facilitating the review and evaluation of such libraries for
        certification by users and organization such as <a class="ulink" src="@//www.boost.org" target="_top">Boost</a>. I also wanted to entice
        <a class="ulink" src="@//www.boost.org" target="_top">Boost</a> into helping promote
        this concept.</p></li></ul></div><p>That is, while specifying the library requirements and suggesting
  tools to be used, we wanted to permit libraries to use their own tools if
  the author desired. This means that we can add per-existing conforming
  libraries to the site without disruption. Also, in practice, there is a wide
  variety of size of libraries. Some are very small maybe one header file,
  while others might be very large. So its very likely that different
  solutions for things like issue tracking, documentation preparation etc.
  might vary. Finally, tools evolve. In the last ten years, preference in
  source control systems has evolved from CVS to SVN to GIT. We want to permit
  library tools to evolve as well. It is for this reason we don't implement
  facilities such as issue tracking in this website but rather expect the a
  library submission provide links to where these facilities are actually
  implemented.</p><div class="section" title="Prior Art"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm513267225296"></a>Prior Art</h3></div></div></div><p>There are pieces of this all over the place.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><a class="ulink" src="@//sourceforge.net" target="_top">sourceforge</a></p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><a class="ulink" src="http://rrsd.com/website/https://github.com" target="_top">github</a></p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><a class="ulink" src="http://rrsd.com/website/www.rypll.org" target="_top">rypll</a></p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>many more</p></li></ul></div><p>These were interesting in that they focused on providing a unitified
    system for library development. I was never sold on the idea that one
    could be successful by telling C++ programmers what to do. (I can get
    barely get anyone to listen to my suggestions). And besides - it's a huge
    amount of work do something of this scale.</p><p>So my approach was to make a "facade" which would</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>permit an author to use what he already has for repository,
          issues, testing dashboard, etc. This would make it easier to make a
          submission. So far this has worked out well. There are already
          multiple kinds of repositories and test dashboards being used by
          different authors. Apparently they had no problem making a
          submission. The main obstacle for a submission is that I require
          browsable html documentation. Even this low bar keeps out much
          useless code.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>present a unified interface to a variety of underlying tool
          implementations. The user interface is a "facade". This is to make
          it easy to browse documentation, code and issues, etc. in a more or
          less unified way. I want a user to be able to evaluate 10 libraries
          in an hour so he can accept one for his own application. Currently
          this takes a couple of days to do.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Not have to do any of the facilities myself since it's
          pointless to replicate other's work - and let them maintain it. If
          they do a bad job - then authors will switch and just update their
          links. You can see the whole point is for me to avoid doing any
          actual work - which of course is why I'm a software developer in the
          first place.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>provide mentoring for library authors to maximize the success
          of their efforts.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>build on and support the Boost review system. </p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Implementation Alternatives Considered"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm513267212192"></a>Implementation Alternatives Considered</h3></div></div></div><p>I wanted a website that had all the features that modern websites
    should have:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Aesthetically pleasing with good typography, flowing text,
        etc.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Ease of maintenance, update, etc.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Accept commentary and library submissions.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Appropriate user control and spam suppression</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Exploit modern social media features such as RSS feeds, Facebook
        Favorites, per library and per page nested comment threads to
        facilitate library development. Perhaps these will become a permanent
        historical record which gathers all the "extra" information required.
        Also this will permit users to leave hints for those users which
        follow. It's about organizing information which is now all over the
        place.</p></li></ul></div><p>Achieving the above turns out to be much more effort than one would
    think. The whole web development universe turns out to be a very
    unpleasant place for a C++ programmer. I won't spend time with the
    details, but here are some of the options I considered.</p><div class="section" title="PERL"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm513267205824"></a>PERL</h4></div></div></div><p>Previously, many years ago, I made some websites. To implement
      forms I used PERL. It was easy to use, but ended up very much a hack.
      Good enough for the simple things I wanted to do then, but I knew
      immediately that I needed more help than PERL could offer.</p></div><div class="section" title="RVSiteBuilder"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm513267204384"></a>RVSiteBuilder</h4></div></div></div><p>This is a website builder which generates all the site pages by
      answering questions. Actually not bad as far as it goes - it can only go
      so far. Fortunately I didn't have to invest a huge amount of time to
      understand that it wasn't going to do the job.</p></div><div class="section" title="PHP"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm513267202960"></a>PHP</h4></div></div></div><p>I looked at PHP and was quite impressed. </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Excellent documentation of the language and libraries. This
            really impressed me. Also all the documentation pages permit
            additional explanation, examples, etc. To be added by the
            community. This turns out to be very, very helpful. I resolved to
            include such a facility on this web site as well. I also
            considered the possibility of permitting users to annotate
            documentation of submitted library documentation. I set that idea
            aside as it would take me further off course, but I remain
            intrigued with it.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The PHP language is sort of "irregular" in comparison with
            C++. It's sort of a poor man's C++ interpreter. But in reality
            this isn't a huge problem as the task for which PHP is used -
            creating dynamic web pages - isn't all that demanding.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Web pages generated with PHP tend to be HTML interspersed
            with PHP (or vice versa). Since a lot of it isn't carefully
            written, it turns out to be indecipherable to the human
            brain.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>I'm not sure if there is a way to debug it interactively. At
            the vary least it would require a server on one's local system. I
            didn't think I should have to go to all that trouble just for a
            relatively simple application.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>I'm not sure how much overhead dynamically interpreting PHP
            adds to the serving of web pages. I just assumed that it would not
            be an issue on this low traffic web site.</p></li></ul></div><p>I actually made a prototype web site using just PHP. It was not
      unsatisfactory, but by this time I became enamored with the ability to
      comment on submissions and pages and added this facility as a
      requirement. Also, maintenance would be an issue. So I resolved to find
      a more complete solution.</p></div><div class="section" title="TikiWiki, Media Wiki, etc."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm513267195408"></a>TikiWiki, Media Wiki, etc.</h4></div></div></div><p>Having seen the PHP documentation and being a being a huge fan of
      <a class="ulink" src="@//www.wikipedia.org/" target="_top">WikiPedia</a>, I investigated
      <a class="ulink" src="@//www.mediawiki.org" target="_top">MediaWiki </a>and other Wiki
      systems. There are many of these. Most are written in PHP. After
      spending too much time, I concluded that making this do what I want
      would entail too much work and resolved to look elsewhere.</p></div><div class="section" title="Wordpress"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm513267192992"></a><a class="ulink" src="http://rrsd.com/website/www.wordpress.org" target="_top">Wordpress</a></h4></div></div></div><p>Next I tried <a class="ulink" src="http://rrsd.com/website/www.wordpress.org" target="_top">Wordpress</a>.
      This is a very impressive setup.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>A complete system for administering the site including
            users, pages, PHP code etc.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>An architecture which supports "plugins" and "themes". These
            permit one to decouple - to some extent, the look and feel of the
            sight from the content. There are thousands of plugins and themes
            available. They are easy to try out. Turns out that most of these
            are deficient in some way so one has to try quite a few of them to
            get things just right. It's no perfect, but it's great when it
            works.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Documentation is not too bad. In addition, there are books
            available.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Support for commenting on library submissions and web pages.
            This includes spam filtering, user logins, email notification,
            etc.</p></li></ul></div><p>So it was a good start. However, getting things "just right"
      finally meant learning quite about the whole system which consumed a lot
      of time. Like most things, it has to be "made to work". Still, all in
      all I got it to make most of the things in this site work the way I
      wanted.</p><p>The result you see here is a customization of a standard <a class="ulink" src="http://rrsd.com/website/www.wordpress.org" target="_top">Wordpress</a> theme. This required
      approximately 1000 lines of PHP code and 13 (at last count) free and
      paid <a class="ulink" src="http://rrsd.com/website/www.wordpress.org" target="_top">Wordpress</a> plug-ins. Trying
      to count all the <a class="ulink" src="http://rrsd.com/website/www.wordpress.org" target="_top">Wordpress</a> and
      plug-in code included would be hard to do - but I doubt it would be less
      than 20,000 lines. I don't know if another tool (that I didn't look at)
      would have made the job easier, faster or better. I just stopped looking
      when I found something that could do the job.</p></div><div class="section" title="Other Tools"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm513267184000"></a>Other Tools</h4></div></div></div><p>Editing of these pages is done in XML using XMLMind and DocBook
