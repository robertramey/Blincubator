    Boost, it will very likely depend upon other boost library components. Do
    not test your code against the Boost Trunk. Consider the
    following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>You're using Boot Test Library to test your library.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The Boost Test author makes a change and tests it on his own
          system.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>He uploads it to the trunk for testing on all other
          compilers/OS combination which Boost Supports.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Over the next few days it turns out that the code is broken on
          some platforms he couldn't test on. So he endeavors to make the code
          fixes required.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Meanwhile, you've updated your local copy and you test your
          new library. But now you get a number of subtle problems of unknown
          origin. You have to spend a lot of time tracking down errors which
          are not in your own code at all! This is a huge waste of
          time.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Eventually, the Boost Test Library author get's all the tests
          passing and the problem goes away - IF you happen to update your
          local copy from the trunk in the meantime.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>This scenario supposes that you've only got one Boot Library
          dependency in your code. In reality, due to the nested library
          structure of all software libraries, you'll actually be dependent on
          dozens of other libraries which your are not even aware of.</p></li></ul></div><p>Using the Boost Trunk copy of libraries is a huge waste
    of your time - don't do it!</p></div>
