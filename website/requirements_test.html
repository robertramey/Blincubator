  spite of having a detailed standard supported by a very dedicated group of
  volunteers, C++ programs cannot be guarenteed to be portable. This is due to
  a couple of factors</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>There exist many C++ constructs which are legal syntax but whose
        semantics are undefined. Usually these aren't even flagged as warnings
        by the compiler. It's very easy to inadvertently and unknowingly write
        code which depends on this undefined behavior. Its very common for
        code which passes test on the developer's environment to fail when
        moved to another. Many developers test on multiple platforms for this
        reason. This helps, but it means that code only get's tested on the
        most commonly available platforms.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>All code depends upon other code libraries. Given the size of
        these libraries - e.g. the C++ standard library - it's inevitable that
        there will be subtle variations in implementation and interface of
        these other libraries.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>All compilers have bugs.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>All compilers omit some feature of the latest C++ standard.
        Older but still widely used compilers omit many features of the latest
        standard. It's not at all easy to keep track of which
        compilers/libraries support which features.</p></li></ul></div><p>One of the key features of Boost libraries is that they are
  extensively tested. This is done by volunteers who test all the libraries on
  particular platforms. From our perspective, this has a number of
  drawbacks:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>It is very demanding on the volunteers. Usually takes all night
        to run tests on all of boost.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The environments being tested might or might not be the same as
        those platforms that users actually use.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>It's not obvious how to test just one library.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>It only includes libraries already accepted into boost. So it is
        of no help to target audience of this web site.</p></li></ul></div><p>To address these considerations we will require that every
  library submission include the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>A reasonably complete set of tests which can be run by anyone who
      downloads the library.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A test script for running these tests.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Logging and display of test results from other library
      users.</p></li></ul></div><p>This will permit any users of a submitted library to run his own
  tests. It will also permit prospective library users to get some idea as to
  how the library might work in his particular environment before he even
  downloads it.</p><p>Elsewhere on this website, we'll describe the test system we
  recommend.</p></div>
