  extensively tested. This is done by volunteers who test all the libraries on
  particular platforms. From our perspecitve here, this has a number of
  drawbacks:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>It is very demanding on the voluteers. Usually takes all night
        to run tests on all of boost.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The environments being tested might or might not be the same as
        those platforms that users actually use.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>It's not obvious how to test just one library.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>It only includes libraries already accepted into boost. So it is
        of no help to target audience of this web site.</p></li></ul></div><p>To address these considerations we will require that every
  library submission include the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>A reasonably complete set of tests which can be run by anyone who
      downloads the library.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A test script for running these tests.</p></li></ul></div><p>This will permit any users of a submitted library to run his own
  tests. </p><p>Elsewhere on this website, we'll describe the test system we
  recommend.</p></div>
