<div class="section" title="Write Code, Concepts, Tests and Documentation Concurrently"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="idm431888967408"></a>Write Code, Concepts, Tests and Documentation Concurrently</h2></div></div><hr></div><p>This is what we usually do to make a library or other body of
    code:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>write all the code</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>write some tests</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>change all the code and tests until the tests to pass on our
        platform</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>start writing documentation and examples</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>upload it and ask people to try it out</p></li></ul></div><p>This approach has a couple of problems.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Coding is fun, while the ancillary tasks can be very boring,
        tedious and frustrating. So leaving these other tasks as an
        afterthought results in poor and/or incomplete documentation, testing,
        and concept definition.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Conceptual errors are often discovered when writing
        documentation, tests and concepts. Discovery of these errors usually
        results in changed to the code which ripple through the whole library
        and create a lot of work.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Poor/Incomplete documentation/testing/concepts mean that fewer
        conceptual errors are discovered before code is made available to
        users.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Users will be shipped code which is weak on documentation,
        tests, and examples and has conceptual errors. Often the library
        writer doesn't do this intentionally, it's just an effect of the way
        the code has been developed. Users will discover these problems,
        reject the library and move on. If the library writer get's any
        feedback it is likely to be of limited usefulness.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>So reworking code and documentation after everything is "done"
        results in a huge amount of extra work - if the work every get's
        done.</p></li></ul></div><p>The basic problem is that the ancillary tasks create a lot of useful
    information and this needs to be cycled back into the library code before
    anything is shipped. Cycling this information back sooner saves wasted
    time.</p><p>Here is what I recommend instead:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>write a small group of classes. functions, or templates.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>use concepts - what are concepts?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>write documentation for this group</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>write and newly required concept checking classes</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>write a program to test this code</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Repeat above for the next group.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>When there is enough to be truely useful to someone, upload the
        package as ask people to test it. The package may not have all the
        features planned for it, but it should have enough functionality to be
        useful.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Monitor feedback.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>add features and make adjustments and repeat cycle above.</p></li></ul></div><p>In contrast to the first approach.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Coding, testing, documentation, are divided into shorter tasks.
        So the tedium and frustration are much easier to deal with.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Information gleaned from documentation, testing, concepts, and
        user feedback is received sooner and saves much rework and back
        tracking.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The result is a higher quality library which:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Exhibits "conceptual integrity". That is, code with a
              clearly defined purpose which is explained in an way which makes
              it obvious what the code is meant to do and how to use
              it.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Motviates the user to take the code for a "test drive" by
              including the code in his own application. This should that
              convince the user that the library is bug free, useful, and easy
              to use.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Results in the user returning positive feedback and
              request for more features.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Motivates the library writer and perhaps other users to
              add features to the library.</p></li></ul></div></li></ul></div></div>
