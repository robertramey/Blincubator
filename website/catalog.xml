   Pointers to local copies of xml resources used by XSLT processor.
   Note: xsltproc fails to adequately handle spaces in files names so
   don't use them.  Also, it's not clear that the windows version 
   can handle the C:/... syntax for a path name.

       Note: the pathname to ../tools is not strictly correct - that is no such
       pathname actually exists.  Rather than use the "real" pathname:
		https://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/branches/release/tools/boostbook/...
            But all we really need is that it be unique. So we choose one which
            isn't tied to the SVN system.
       NOTE: Replace "c:/BoostRelease" with the contents of your $BOOST_ROOT variable
