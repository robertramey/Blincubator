      You can just drop in and participate if you're in the area !!!. I'm

    method used will be peer critique. In order to participate as an Observer,
    all one has to do is show up. In order to participate as an author, one
    must:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Have a library in progress.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Have documentation and perhaps code which is accessible
          online.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Create a comment entry below which includes</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Name of the library</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Short description of what the library does</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Links to documentation and perhaps code</p></li></ul></div><p>Create your entry as soon as you know you'll be attending the
          workshop as an author. This way we'll be able to save you a
          space.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Program"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm451233159856"></a>Program</h3></div></div></div><p>The workshop will operate on the following schedule:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>8:30 PM - 8:35 PM I will introduce the workshop with a short
          summary of these rules and answer any questions.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>8:35 PM - 9:00 PM Each library author will make a very short
          presentation (~3 min) of what his library attempts to
          accomplish.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>9:00 PM Authors draw lots to select a library other than their
          own. Observers are also permitted to draw lots or just select a
          library they might be interested in. Observers might choose to leave
          at this point.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>9:00 PM - 10:00 PM Each selected library is &#8220;critiqued&#8221; by
          reading through the documentation and perhaps code while building a
          contemporaneous log on the experience. This log will be posted as a
          comment below.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>10:00 PM - Pencils down - wrap up. Authors may read and
          optionally reply to critiques at their leisure.</p></li></ul></div><p>I will be available to answer questions and provide encouragement.
    Hopefully I can convince another boost library author to attend</p></div></div>
