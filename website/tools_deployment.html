  Submission Page</a> fulfills the requirements for deployment of a
  library. When the form is submitted, it is checked by a human to verify that
  all the information is properly filled in and that the submission fulfils
  all the requirements of this website.</p><p>The form contains links to where the required facilities such as
  reviews, documentation, download, code repository, and issue tracking. That
  is, this website does not implement all the facilities required. For
  example, we require an issue tracking system, but don't implement one here.
  Even if we do provide such an implementation in the future, library
  submissions will not be required to use it. This policy/design provides a
  number of benefits:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Library authors can use their preferred set of resources. In
        many cases, library authors have these things already set up there is
        nothing to do but to link to them.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Libraries differ greatly in their requirements. A very small
        header library may not need a full featured/elaborate revision
        tracking system while a larger complex library might require such a
        system. This model permits each library to choose the best set of
        resources.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>As time passes, better facilities become available. If a library
        author wants to migrate his revision control system from one to
        another he can do that without having to get permission from some
        higher coordinating authority.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Library modularization is encouraged. Users will download the
        libraries which interest them - not necessarily some whole set. For a
        library to be successful, it will have to minimize unnecessary
        coupling to other libraries. This is a good thing.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>We expect users who download libraries on this site to run the
        regression/acceptance tests on their local platform and report their
        results to a central site. This distributes testing among users in way
        that will always scale.</p></li></ul></div><p>This deployment model contrasts starkly with that of Boost itself.
  Boost is distinguished by</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The libraries are distributed all at once in one large zip file or
      tarball. Once one downloads and installs this package, he has all he
      boost libraries available. Any decision to change the composition of
      this package - e.g. Deprecation of a library, is arrived at by consensus
      of boost developers. Since testing occurs every day on the whole
      distribution, users can be confident that everything will work even if
      libraries have been coupled together - inadvertently or
      otherwise.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>libraries don't have their own version numbers. Version numbers
      are assigned to each boost distribution. Note that the recent Boost
      modularization requires per library version numbers, but this
      requirement is not yet enforced.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>All libraries use the same system for code repositories, reviews,
      issue tracking and the like. Any change in the selection of these
      facilities can only occur by reaching a consensus of boost
      developers.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Test are run on all the whole boost distribution every day. The
      system works amazingly well. But it takes quite a bit of resources at
      the testing sites.</p></li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Links"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm226406929008"></a>Links</h3></div></div></div><p>The <a href="submit-my-library">Library Submission Page</a>

    of online services</a> for hosting a library. I've spent some time
    investigating some of the more popular one. They all provide some of the
    services described above - but none of them provides them all. Of course
    there is no reason that a library has to depend on only one of these
    services. One can just as well register his library on more than one
    service and use the <a href="submit-my-library">Library Submission
    Page</a> as a gateway to the various facilities used.</p><p>Here is my short assessment of some of the more popular services.
    For illustrative purposes we've used the safe numerics library to show how
    links should be filled for on each service on our <a href="submit-my-library">Library Submission Page</a> .</p><div class="section" title="Google Code"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm226406912816"></a>Google Code</h4></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Reviews - not supported.

      own separate repository on GitHub. Experience with this has been very
      positive. Given all this, GitHub would have to be the preferred choice
