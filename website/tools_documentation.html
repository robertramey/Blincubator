    locally. The <a href="requirements_directory_structure">library
    directory structure</a> includes a directory labeled HTML for this
    purpose. The decision as to how to generate these pages is left to the
    library author. In considering a toolset to perform this function, I've
    developed my own personal wish list:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Wide support</em></span> from some user/development

          is derived from DocBook, it inherits all the rules from DocBook, and

          being available for future use. This would be OK except for the fact

          BoostBuild, using the HTML/PDF which is left somewhere else in the
          local Boost directory. That is, conversion of documents in

      rules is very tedious. To address this issue, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_49_0/doc/html/quickbook.html" target="_top">QuickBook</a>
      was created. It has it own, much simpler, set of syntax rules for
      creating documentation. <a class="ulink" href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_49_0/doc/html/quickbook.html" target="_top">QuickBook</a>
      files are created with any text editor. The output from QuickBook is XML
      which follows the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_49_0/doc/html/boostbook.html" target="_top">BoostBook</a>
      rules. This output is processed as would any <a class="ulink" href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_49_0/doc/html/boostbook.html" target="_top">BoostBook</a>
      XML would be. <a class="ulink" href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_49_0/doc/html/quickbook.html" target="_top">QuickBook</a>
      has been popular. Approximately 1/3 of the boost libraries use it. Of
      course that's another way of saying that 2/3 of the libraries don't use

I sill has a few disadvantages:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>It's not a WYSIWYG editor.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>It's yet another "little language" to learn.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Like many "little languages" it's not that easy to extend if

        requires. I've also added some "templates" for C++ library
        documentation elements: library, concept, type, and function. So one
        can build his documentation from within the editor by adding in the
        standard templates and "filling in the blanks". This will go a long
        way to making "C++ library formal documentation" with a minimum of

        ones. These just remove the requirement that the XML files be part of
        the standard Boost Source tree. Finally, I've set up a directory
        containing all the DocBook stuff so that I can create HTML
        documentation with a three line batch file. This has made my
        documentation system usable without using BoostBuild and without
        having to make a source tree which looks like boost. Finally, the

          this reason, it's very helpful to use copy/paste of "branches" which
          are already complete. This speeds up the process considerably for
          things like tables, etc.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Lookup the "node selection bar" in the XMLMind help. This is
          key to understanding where you are in the node tree.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Edit in WYSIWYG mode. This guarantees that your document

      format we can render it in a variety of formats. This is done with the
      BoostBook toolset. In the official Boost distribution, this is done with
      BoostBuild. We use a simpler more transparent method. Creating HTML
      documentation is a two step process using XSLT.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Translate BoostBook XML to DocBook XML XSL style sheets</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Translate the resulting DocBook XML to HTML DocBook style

xsltproc --nonet --xinclude $BOOST_ROOT/tools/boostbook/xsl/html.xsl db2html.xsl -</code></pre><p>In addition, we need to copy a few files from the boost
      installation. The following files should be copied to the HTML directory
      from the boost root directory.</p><p><code class="filename">doc/src/boostbook.css </code>// cascaded style sheet
      to give boost "look and feel"</p><p><code class="filename">doc/html/images</code> // directory of images for
      arrows, etc.</p><p>and finally you should add to the HTML directory a file named
      <code class="filename">pre-boost.jpg</code>. After all this, the HTML
      documentation director structure should look something like the
      following</p><pre><code>doc/
  html/
    boostbook.css
    index.html
    other html files ....
    images/
        png files ...
  boostbook/
    db2html.xsl
    xml files containing boost book documentation
    makehtml.bat // batch file which creates html from boostbook xml
    makehtml.sh  // batch file which creates html from boostbook xml</code></pre><p>The logo on your documentation can be changed either by replacing
      the <code class="filename">pre-boost.jpg</code> with your own or editing the
      <code class="filename">dbt2html.xsl</code> to point to a different logo.</p></div><div class="section" title="Customizing HTML Output"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm100877471904"></a>Customizing HTML Output</h4></div></div></div><p>The above procedure requires the existence of an xml "style sheet"
      prepare in the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/index.html" target="_top">XML style sheet
      language</a>. This language is which will look something like the
      following: This specifies various parameters which customize the HTML
      output according to taste.</p><pre><code>&lt;?xml version='1.0'?&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" version="1.0"&gt;

&lt;!-- ************** HTML ************** --&gt;
&lt;xsl:import href="http://www.boost.org/tools/boostbook/xsl/html.xsl"/&gt;

&lt;!--
Make library documentation header using some elements from boostbook stylesheets.
Override boost book implemenation of header.navigation with our own
--&gt;
&lt;xsl:template name = "header.navigation"&gt;
    &lt;xsl:param name = "prev" select = "/foo"/&gt;
    &lt;xsl:param name = "next" select = "/foo"/&gt;
    &lt;xsl:param name = "nav.context"/&gt;
    &lt;table cellpadding = "2" width = "100%"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td valign = "top"&gt;
            &lt;img href="index.html" height="164px" src="pre-boost.jpg" alt="Library Documentation Index" /&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Safe Numerics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;xsl:call-template name = "navbar.spirit"&gt;
       &lt;xsl:with-param name = "prev" select = "$prev"/&gt;
       &lt;xsl:with-param name = "next" select = "$next"/&gt;
       &lt;xsl:with-param name = "nav.context" select = "$nav.context"/&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;

&lt;!-- remove "Chapter 1" from first page --&gt;
&lt;xsl:param name="chapter.autolabel" select="0"/&gt;
&lt;!-- leave the html files in the directory ../html --&gt;
&lt;xsl:param name="base.dir" select="'../html/'"/&gt;

&lt;!-- ******* Table of Contents ******** --&gt;
&lt;!-- How far down sections get TOC's --&gt;
&lt;xsl:param name = "toc.section.depth" select="2" /&gt;

&lt;!-- Max depth in each TOC: --&gt;
&lt;xsl:param name = "toc.max.depth" select="2" /&gt;

&lt;!-- How far down we go with TOC's --&gt;
&lt;xsl:param name="generate.section.toc.level" select="1" /&gt;

&lt;!-- ************ Chunking ************ --&gt;

&lt;!--
BoostBook takes a section node id like safe_numeric.safe_cast
and renders it as safe_numeric/safe_cast. Presumably they do this
so they can make a huge "book" with all the libraries in subdirectories.
But we want something different.  To my mind, this should have been
done using the library "directory" attribute.  But of course that
doesn't matter now.  We'll just re-hack the path to eliminate
the "safe_numeric/" from the above example.
--&gt;

&lt;xsl:template match="*" mode="recursive-chunk-filename"&gt;
    &lt;xsl:variable name="their"&gt;
        &lt;xsl:apply-imports mode="recursive-chunk-filename" select="."/&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:variable&gt;
    &lt;xsl:choose&gt;
    &lt;xsl:when test="contains($their, '/')"&gt;
        &lt;xsl:value-of select="substring-after($their, '/')" /&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:when&gt;
    &lt;xsl:otherwise&gt;
        &lt;xsl:value-of select="$their"/&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:otherwise&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:choose&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;

&lt;!-- don't make first sections special - leave TOC in different file --&gt;
&lt;xsl:param name="chunk.first.sections" select="3" /&gt;

&lt;!-- How far down we chunk nested sections --&gt;
&lt;!-- 
Note: each chunk have to start with  a section with an id
Otherwise the chunk (i.e. file) will be lost.  There is no 
checking of this
--&gt;
&lt;xsl:param name="chunk.section.depth" select="1" /&gt;

&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;</code></pre><p>The key features which we can specify are </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>HTML Page Header including logo and Title</p><p>We do this overriding the Boost Book default implemenation
            of the "header.navigation" template with our own.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>"Chunking" - to specifying HTML output is divided into
            files.</p><p>DocBook includes parameters to specify how the html output
            is broken into files. In DocBook parlance, this is refered to as
            "chunking". The DocBook rules for chunking are a little complex,
            but are well explained in the DocBook documentation. In practice,
            the defaults mostly work and you won't have to spend too much
            time. Make sure that you use the "id" element to assign a name to
            each section which might start an new file. If you don't do this,
            the file won't be created and you'll be given no error message
            explaining why!</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Table of Contents - specifications</p><p>DocBook includes a number of parameters which can be used to
