<div class="section" title="Library Requirements"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="requirements"></a>Library Requirements</h2></div></div><hr></div><p>Any library submitted to this site must fullfill a set of minimum set
  of requirements. These requirements are formutated in order to make it as
  simple as possible to download a library, test and use it. The only
  requirement that a potential user should have to fullfill is that the a
  recent copy of Boost Libraries be installed.</p><p>Note that some of these requirements may differ somewhat from the
  official Boost ones. So if the library moves off this site into the official
  Boost distribution. Some changes will have to be made. These changes should
  be easy to make and not require much additional investment of effort.</p></div>
