<div class="section" title="Build and Test"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="tools_build_and_test"></a>Build and Test</h2></div></div><hr></div><p>There is a bewildering array of <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_build_automation_software" target="_top">build
  systems</a>. None of them are really satisfactory. I had hoped to avoid
  imposing any requirement as to the build/test system and leave the option to
  each library author to choose what he felt was most convenient. Some
  experimentation with my prototype library safe_numerics convinced me that
  this wasn't realistic and that I would have to require a specific build/test
  system. I wanted a system which:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>would work on the wide variety of environments on which C++ is
        run.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>would gracefully handle variants debug/release, dll/static
        libraries, etc.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>didn't require any customization for each environment.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>would include the ability to support both building AND testing
        of libraries</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>didn't require elaborate installation and/or scripting.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>didn't much, if any, learning curve.</p></li></ul></div><p>I looked at a few specific alternatives.</p><div class="section" title="Alternatives Considered"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm114023403040"></a>Alternatives Considered</h3></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Make"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm114023402400"></a>Make</h4></div></div></div><p>In the spirit of keeping things as simple as possible, this was my
      first choice. But starting with a basic make file, one would need to add
      a lot of extras functionality to address the requirements in the above
      list. Basic make doesn't have enough functionality to support all we
      need so we're forced to specify a build/test system.</p></div><div class="section" title="Autotools"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm114023400880"></a>Autotools</h4></div></div></div><p>Autotools is the traditional Unix solution to the problem of
      build/test/deployment. It has a long history and is widely used. There
      is lot's of literature on it as well. It garners a number of complaints
      about how hard it is to use - but then it seems all of these build
      systems share that trait. And it doesn't do windows which is sort of
      deal killer for us. None the less, I wanted to take a look at it. First
      I looked at my books. It was explained but it did seem pretty
      complicated. I trolled the net and found a couple of references:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><a class="ulink" href="http://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/EZAG/abstracts/talk-20070615_2.pdf#page=16" target="_top">http://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/EZAG/abstracts/talk-20070615_2.pdf#page=16</a></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="ulink" href="http://mij.oltrelinux.com/devel/autoconf-automake/" target="_top">http://mij.oltrelinux.com/devel/autoconf-automake/</a></p></li></ul></div><p>The first one has a graphic on page 16 which helped make it clear
      how all the pieces of this system fit together. On the other hand, this
      graphic didn't make it look very easy. I went through the process with
      my unix-like CYGWIN installation and things seemed to run well until the
      last step. Again, I had the feeling I could make this work if I was
      willing to put in more time, but I didn't feel like doing it. An
      interesting experience but not a good solution for us.</p></div><div class="section" title="Boost Build"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm114023395712"></a><a href="tools_bjam">Boost Build</a></h4></div></div></div></div><div class="section" title="CMake/CTest"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm114023393808"></a><a href="tools_cmake">CMake/CTest</a></h4></div></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm114023391984"></a>Summary</h4></div></div></div><p>Basically I didn't find what I was looking for. I believe that
      all/any of these build tools could have been made to work, but at a
      significant overhead cost and learning curve. Turns out I'm not alone.
      Searching for a good build system hits dozens of <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_build_automation_software" target="_top">tools</a>
      with a huge variety of features and capabilities. These tools have been
      contributed over more than a decade with arriving all the time.
      Commentary, critique and comparison of all these options strongly
      suggest that this problem isn't close to being solved yet. So it's fair
      to assume it's much harder than it would first seem to solve this
      problem.</p><p>Here is a list of miscellaneous links to sites that I found useful
      in my investigation of Build systems.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_build_automation_software" target="_top">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_build_automation_software</a></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div>
