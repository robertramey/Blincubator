<div class="section" title="Build and Test"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="tools_build_and_test"></a>Build and Test</h2></div></div><hr></div><p>There is a bewildering array of <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_build_automation_software" target="_top">build
  systems</a>. None of them are really satisfactory. I had hoped to avoid
  imposing any requirement as to the build/test system and leave the option to
  each library author to choose what he felt was most convenient. Some
  experimentation with my prototype library safe_numerics convinced me that
  this wasn't realistic and that I would have to require a specific build/test
  system. I wanted a system which:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>would work on the wide variety of environments on which C++ is
        run.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>would gracefully handle build variants such as debug/release,
        dll/static libraries, etc.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>didn't require any customization for each environment.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>didn't require elaborate installation and/or scripting.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>minimized the learning curve.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>would include the ability to support both building AND testing
        of libraries.</p><p>This last has turned out to be particularly problematic.
        Repeatable, portable unit testing is essential to development of
        robust software. We require a system which supports the
        following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Run by developer in his local enviroment before code is
            committed.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Run by prospective library users when library is
            downloaded.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Log of test results from various users posted in a public
            place which is easily viewable by library developers, users and
            reviewers.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Is scalable - doesn't require some centralized testing
            setup.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Tests with a wide variety of platforms and compilers.</p></li></ul></div></li></ul></div><p>I looked at a few specific alternatives.</p><div class="section" title="Make"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm462239179024"></a>Make</h3></div></div></div><p>In the spirit of keeping things as simple as possible, this was my
    first choice. But starting with a basic make file, one would need to add a
    lot of extras functionality to address the requirements in the above list.
    Basic make doesn't have enough functionality to support all we need so
    we're forced to specify a build/test system.</p></div><div class="section" title="Autotools"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm462239177520"></a>Autotools</h3></div></div></div><p>Autotools is the traditional Unix solution to the problem of
    build/test/deployment. It has a long history and is widely used. There is
    lot's of literature on it as well. It garners a number of complaints about
    how hard it is to use - but then it seems all of these build systems share
    that trait. And it doesn't do windows which is sort of deal killer for us.
    None the less, I wanted to take a look at it. First I looked at my books.
    It was explained but it did seem pretty complicated. I trolled the net and
    found a couple of references:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><a class="ulink" href="http://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/EZAG/abstracts/talk-20070615_2.pdf#page=16" target="_top">http://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/EZAG/abstracts/talk-20070615_2.pdf#page=16</a></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="ulink" href="http://mij.oltrelinux.com/devel/autoconf-automake/" target="_top">http://mij.oltrelinux.com/devel/autoconf-automake/</a></p></li></ul></div><p>The first one has a graphic on page 16 which helped make it clear
    how all the pieces of this system fit together. On the other hand, this
    graphic didn't make it look very easy. I went through the process with my
    unix-like CYGWIN installation and things seemed to run well until the last
    step. Again, I had the feeling I could make this work if I was willing to
    put in more time, but I didn't feel like doing it. An interesting
    experience but not a good solution for us.</p></div><div class="section" title="Summary and Conclusion"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm462239171264"></a>Summary and Conclusion</h3></div></div></div><p>After trying and/or investigating many of the alternatives, I've
    settled on CMake/CTest/CDash for Safe Numerics. I feel comfortable
    strongly recommending this for those who want to make libraries which they
    hope to submit to Boost. It supports our list of requirements as well as
    any of the other alternatives considered. AND it's the only alternative
    which supports our specific requierments for logging test results in a
    commonly accessable place. As I write this, I see CMake/CTest/CDash as
    indispensible for libraries posted on this website. </p><p>Note the above doesn't preclude support for other build systems as
    well. In particular BJAM might be a candidate if one's library evolves to
    the point of being a serious candidate for inclusion into boost.</p><p>Here is a list of miscellaneous links to sites that I found useful
    in my investigation of Build systems.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_build_automation_software" target="_top">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_build_automation_software</a></p></li></ul></div></div></div>
